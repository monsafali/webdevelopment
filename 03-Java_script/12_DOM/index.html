        <h2>Creation And Development</h2>
        <p>
            In 1962, with the success of the Fantastic Four, Marvel Comics editor and head writer Stan Lee was
            casting for a new superhero idea. He said the idea for Spider-Man arose from a surge in teenage 
            demand for comic books and the desire to create a character with whom teens could identify.[15]:
             1  As with Fantastic Four, Lee saw Spider-Man as an opportunity to "get out of his system" what he 
            felt was missing in comic books.[16] In his autobiography, Lee cites the non-superhuman pulp magazine
            crime fighter the Spider as a great influence,[14]: 130 [17] and in a multitude of print and video 
            interviews, Lee stated he was further inspired by seeing a spider climb up a wall—adding in his 
            autobiography that he has told that story so often he has become unsure of whether or not this is true.
