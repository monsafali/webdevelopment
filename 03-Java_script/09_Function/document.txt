Funciton In js

to perform a specific task. it is a chunk of code.. we can call that block of code.

function definition(teling js){
    //do something
}




funciton with arguments
function greting(a,b){
    do something
}

values we pass to the funciton




Return
return keywod is used to return some value for the function
in function after return statement no one statement can run




Scope:
Scope determines the accessibility of variables, objects, and function from different parts of the code.
function Scope
block Scope
lexical Scope

Fuction scope:
Varibles defiend inside a function are not accessible (visible) from outside the funciton
if inside function don't have varible they extract frou out side (global scope) varialbe and print it



Block Scope:

varible declared insid a {} block cannot be accessed from outside the block. 
block scope cannot work in const a let variable



lexical Scope:

A vasriable defined outside a function can be accessible inside another funtion defined after the variable declaration
The opposite is NOt TRue?
