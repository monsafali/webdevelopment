Each instruction waits for the previous instruction to complete its execution.


Asynchronous:
 Due to synchronous programing, sometimes imp instructions get blocked due to some previous instruction, which
causes a dealy in the Ul. Asynchronous code execution to exectue next instruction imeediately and doens't block 
the flows 


call back:
A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function.




Async funciton:


we used throw keyword when we catch some random error


Await Keyword:
pauses the execution of its surrounding async funciton until the promise is settled 
(resolved or rejected)

we only used await keyword whenever over function is async postition
